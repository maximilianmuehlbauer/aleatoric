Some little scripts to create kind of aleatoric music.
Requires sox to be installed - on Ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install sox libsox-fmt-mp3

First run generate.py play [rendertype] | generate [synth [synthtype (see man sox, e.g. guitar)]]
then  run concatenate.py
then  run mix.sh
then  run clean.sh
ready!
